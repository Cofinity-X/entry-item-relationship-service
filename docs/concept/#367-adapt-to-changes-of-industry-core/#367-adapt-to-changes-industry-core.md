# Overview

The "Industry Core" is a fundamental element in the C-X network or system architecture.
It provides essential functions for identification, traversal, data flow, configuration, and communication in a modular and
interconnected environment.
The goal is to make components identifiable and discoverable at type and instance levels.
Enable seamless traversal across different tier levels.
Facilitate the creation of data chains.
Crucial role in configuring enablement services for component-based data exchange
Notification base message exchange.

1. Identifiability and findability
2. Traversing Across multiple tier levels
3. Facilitate Data Chains
4. Configuration for Enablement Services
5. Components-Based Data Exchange
The core enables the sending of notifications, indicating that there's a mechanism for alerting or informing relevant parties about specific events or changes within the system.

# Glossary

| Abbreviation | Name                    | Description                                              |
|--------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ECU          | Electronic Control Unit | An ECU's main job is to keep the engine working smoothly |
| JIS          | Just In Sequence        | Just-in-sequence is a delivery concept where parts are delivered to the production plant at a requested time in the exact order of installation, typically for a 1:1 dependency on the manufactured product. A just-in-sequence-part is a part for which this concept and order of delivery applies and which does not have a dedicated serial number (then it would be considered a serialized part). Examples for JIS-parts are seats and bumpers.                                    |
| BPN | Business Partner Number | A BPN is the unique identifier of a partner within Catena-x. |
|  |Part Instance|A part instance is a physically produced instance (e.g. serialized part, batch, just-in-sequence-part) of a part type. |
|  |Part Type| A part type is a generic (not physically produced) part on material- or catalog-level as a representation for a designed part.|
| VAN | Vehicle Anonymised Number | A number mapped 1:1 to VIN, but pseudonomised.|
