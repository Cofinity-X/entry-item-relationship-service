# Release Guide for Cofinity-X

## General release conventions / guidelines

Please find [Release Guidelines Upstream](https://github.com/Cofinity-X/item-relationship-service/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#create-a-release)

### Prerequisite:

- Before releasing IRS, it is required to check if the edc client library needs to be released through the [EDC Client Library Release](#edc-client-library-release) steps

### EDC Client Library Release

1) Check if the irs-registry-client version has a -SNAPSHOT suffix:  [IRS Repo](https://github.com/Cofinity-X/item-relationship-service/blob/main/pom.xml)
2) Click on the [Update irs-registry-client Version workflow](https://github.com/Cofinity-X/item-relationship-service/actions/workflows/update-registry-library.yaml).
3) Select "Run workflow" select the type of version increment major, minor or patch (Can be adjusted on generated PR branch). Check the box to remove the snapshot. Click on "Run".
4) A pull request (name: Update irs-registry-client to "Version") will be generated in which you have to make sure the irs lib version is now correct (change it manually if necessary).
5) Merge the generated Pull request
### TODO currently irs cannot publish library for cofinity project
7) The GitHub action [Upload to Central Maven Registry ](https://github.com/Cofinity-X/item-relationship-service/actions/workflows/maven-deploy.yaml) will automatically release the irs-registry-client library with the new version defined in step 4
