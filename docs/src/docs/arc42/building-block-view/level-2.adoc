|Components |Description

|IrsController
|Application REST controller.

|IrsItemGraphQueryService
|Service for retrieving item graph.

|JobOrchestrator
|Orchestrator service for recursive MultiTransferJobs that potentially comprise multiple transfers.

|JobStore
|Spring configuration for job-related beans.

|BlobstorePersistence
|Interface for storing data blobs.

== RecursiveJobHandler

The *RecursiveJobHandler* component provide the logic to build jobs with recursive logic to retrieve items over the complete C-X network and assembles the partial results into a single item graph result.

|AASRecursiveJobHandler
|Recursive job handler for AAS data

|TreeRecursiveLogic
|Retrieves item graphs from potentially multiple calls to IRS API behind multiple EDC Providers, and assembles their outputs into one overall item graph.

|ItemTreesAssembler
|Assembles multiple partial item graphs into one overall item graph.

|BlobPersistence
|Interface for storing data blobs.

== TransferProcessManagement

The TransferProcessManager creates executions and provides them to the executor service. Each execution contains HTTP requests to the asset administration shell registry and to the submodel interface.

|Components |Description

|TransferProcessManager
|The TransferProcessManager manages the requests to the EDC and DigitalTwinRegistry.

|DigitalTwinRegistryFacade
|The DigitalTwinRegistryFacade calls the DigitalTwinRegistry to retrieve data form the AAS registry and transforms the response to internal data models.

|SubmodelFacade
|The SubmodelFacade handles EDC contract negotiation, calls the EDC dataplane to retrieve data from the submodel server and transforms the response to internal data models.
 In order to work with the decentral network approach, the SubmodelFacade requires the "subprotocolBody" to be present in each of the submodelDescriptor endpoints of the digital twin received by the digitalTwinRegistryFacade. This "subprotocolBody" has to contain the "id" of the EDC asset, as well as the "dspEndpoint" of the EDC, separated by a colon "semicolon" (e.g. `"subprotocolBody": "id=123;dspEndpoint=http://edc.control.plane/"`). If the "dspEndpoint" is not present, every available EDC endpoint in DiscoveryService will be queried until a asset with the "id" can be found.

|BlobStore
|The BlobStore is the database where the relationships and tombstones are stored for a requested item.

|DigitalTwinRegistry
|The DigitalTwinRegistry is the central database of registered assets. In a decentralized network, the registry is no longer central, but every provider has its own registry.

|ExecutorService
|The ExecutorService enables the simultaneous execution of requests of transfer processes.
