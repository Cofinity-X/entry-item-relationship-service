## Introduction

### Vision and Mission Statement

The IRS is providing a technical API Endpoint in the Catena-X Network, which builds an item tree representation of given
digital twins stored across the industry. Therefore, it is a key component for the Network to provide data chains along
the value chain in the industry.

The vision for the Item Relationship Service is to provide an easy access endpoint for complex distributed digital twins
across Catena-X members.
It abstracts the access from separated digital twins towards a connected data chain of twins and provides those.
It enables to apply business logic on complex distributed digital twins across company borders.

### What is the IRS?

Within the [Catena-X network](https://catena-x.net/), the so-called Item Relationship Service (IRS) forms an essential
foundation for various services and products. Within the Catena-X use cases, the IRS serves to increase business value.
For example, the IRS provides functionalities to serve requirements, such as occasion-based Traceability,
from the Supply Chain Act. In doing so, IDSA and Gaia-X principles, such as data interoperability and sovereignty, are
maintained on the Catena-X network and access to dispersed data is enabled. Data chains are established as a common
asset.

With the help of the IRS, data chains are to be provided ad-hoc across n-tiers within the Catena-X network.
To realize these data chains, the IRS relies on data models of the Traceability use case and provides the federated
data chains to customers or applications. Furthermore, the target picture of the IRS includes the enablement of new
business areas by means of data chains along the value chain in the automotive industry.

## Source Layout

The IRS project consists of several different parts:

## Installation

This section describes both deployment on [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) via [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and local deployment for development.

### Helm deployment

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)


### Local deployment

The following subsection provides instructions for running the infrastructure on docker-compose and the application in
the IDE.


#### Docker-compose + IDE

- Start the necessary infrastructure by running `docker-compose up`

- Start the application from your favorite IDE. For IntelliJ, a run configuration is available in the .run folder.


#### Local IRS API

- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui
- API docs: http://localhost:8080/api/api-docs
- API docs in yaml:  http://localhost:8080/api/api-docs.yaml


## Usage

### Sample calls
