@TRI-512
Feature: 👍 [AS_PLANNED] BomLifecycle 'asPlanned' implementation (1.0.0)
	#*As* IRS-Consumer,
	#*I want* to be able to traverse through a BOM as planned,
	#*so that* I can use the IRS to access these structures.
	#
	#h2. Details: 
	#* [Details| https://confluence.catena-x.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=53248769]
	#* (!) BOMAsPlanned : Update and extension of BOMAsPlanned is planned for Iteration 2. 
	#* (-) Traversal Aspect SingleLevelBomAsPlanned is used for bomLifecycle": "asPlanned" and direction "downwards"
	#* (-) In case no aspect is choose by the api caller, default aspect "PartAsPlanned" is used for bomLifecycle "asPlanned"
	#
	#h2. Hint / Context : 
	#----
	#* Check Semantic Hub for more detailed information about the Aspects
	#* Aspects are: "PartAsPlanned“ and „SingleLevelBomAsPlanned“
	#* Contact Simon Schulz if further information is needed
	#* Check if namespace starts with _io.catenax_
	#* "SingleLevelBomAsPlanned" results in QueryParameter => "bomLifecycle": "asPlanned",
	#* update local Testdataset with reasonable Testdata (2 levels, 7 Component, each component has PartAsPlanned and SingleLevelBomAsPlanned with 2 children except level2 leafs)
	#* use similar Structure as BomAsBuilt Dataset
	#* https://confluence.catena-x.net/display/PL/Release+2+test+dataset%27s
	#* Testdata: https://confluence.catena-x.net/display/PL/BoMAsPlanned+test+dataset version 1.3.4 asplanned alpha
	#
	#
	#h2. TODO:
	#----
	#* (-) implement functionality
	#* (-) create Test-dataset for BoM as Planned data
	#* (-) create Tests
	#* (-) run Tests
	#* (-) refactor API Documentation
	#
	#h2. Background: 
	#* (/) [~thomas.braun3@zf.com] will take care that testdata for BoM asPlanned are prepared. 
	#* (/) Aspect BoM asPlanned is already available. There is an update until Iteration 2 for . Version 1.0.0
	#* (/) Implementation  BoM AsPlanned im IRS  (Alignment Trace-X Implementation ESS in PI6)
	#* (!) BoM As Planned will be extended Version 1.1.0 will be avaiable in iteration 2.

	Background:
		#@TRI-768
		Given the IRS URL "https://irs.dev.demo.catena-x.net"
		And the admin user api key
		

	#*Used testdataset*: 1.5.0

	#h3. Test Objective:
	#
	#_<What is the test objective>_
	# * Get a complete item graph response for a requested and valid globalAssetId over IRS api.
	#
	#h3. Description:
	#
	#_<Short description of the overall test case>_
	# # Job execution for bom lifecycle "asBuild" and direction downward (AssemblyPartRelationship ) without given graph depth of 2 is registered in IRS processing for requested globalAssetId is initated by an irs api consumer
	# # Job processed builds an item graph using AssemblyPartRelationship aspects discovered over DigitalTwin registry and collected over the related endpoint addresses.
	# # Job is processing the complete item graph and stores the job in the internal job store where it could be requested by the api consumer
	# # Api consumer gets an item graph document with the results for the requested globalAssetId
	#
	#h3. Preconditions:
	#
	#_<Preconditions which have to be fulfilled before test execution>_
	# # DT Twin Registry is up and running and contains valid test data set
	# # Submodel Servers up and running and providing consistent submodel aspects test data aligned with AAS shell endpoints
	# # EDC Consumer is set up and configures to the DT Registry and Submodel 
	# # AASWrapper and AASProxy infrastructure is up and running and configured to EDC Consume
	# # An valid and existing globalAssetId is available, containing AssemblyPartRelationship aspects
