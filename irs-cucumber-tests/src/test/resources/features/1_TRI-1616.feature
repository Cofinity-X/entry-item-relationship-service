	#_<Short description of the overall test case>_
	# # Job execution for bom lifecycle "asBuild" and direction downward (AssemblyPartRelationship ) without given graph depth of 2 is registered in IRS processing for requested globalAssetId is initated by an irs api consumer
	# # Job processed builds an item graph using AssemblyPartRelationship aspects discovered over DigitalTwin registry and collected over the related endpoint addresses.
	# # Job is processing the complete item graph and stores the job in the internal job store where it could be requested by the api consumer
	# # Api consumer gets an item graph document with the results for the requested globalAssetId
